I'm a computer science student with a strong passion for full-stack web development, networking, and cyber security. With hands-on experience in Django and React, I enjoy creating robust and scalable web applications. My background in networking allows me to design and manage efficient and secure networks, while my knowledge of cyber security ensures that the applications I build are protected against modern threats.

Skills and Interests:

    Languages: Python, Java, C++,C, CSS
    Frameworks and Libraries: Django, React, Flask
    Networking: Network design, configuration, and management
    Cyber Security: Fundamental principles, vulnerability assessment, and threat mitigation
    Tools and Technologies: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Wireshark
    Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skill set, and I enjoy collaborating with like-minded professionals to tackle challenging projects.

Projects:

    WebSec Portal: A web application built with Django and React for managing security assessments and reporting vulnerabilities.
    NetMon: A network monitoring tool that helps administrators track network performance and identify potential security issues.
    SecureAuth: An authentication system integrating multi-factor authentication and role-based access control to enhance application security.
